In this project, we've integrated the capabilities of an online OpenAI language model to facilitate the extraction of essential details—such as Name, Email, and Mobile number—from resumes. The process is initiated by prompting the OpenAI model with specific queries tailored for extracting this information. To enhance user interaction, a user-friendly web interface is constructed using Flask and HTML, enabling users to effortlessly upload their resumes and obtain the extracted information.

The workflow is designed to be intuitive: users simply upload their resumes, and the application orchestrates the extraction process through the online OpenAI model, presenting the pertinent details. While the online nature of the OpenAI model provides accessibility, it's important to note that an active internet connection is required for seamless operation and an API key from OpenAI

This project strives to optimize the resume information extraction process by harnessing the capabilities of an online OpenAI model, coupled with an elegant web interface. The goal is to offer users a straightforward and efficient experience in obtaining key details from their resumes.
